**Welcome**<br/>
This is a greenfield project, so everybody is welcome to join and contribute.<br/>
<br/>
*Every idea starts from observation*<br/>
<br/>
**Customer Flow**<br/>
Beauty salons, stylists, hairdressers and barbers do have customers. Once they enter the salon, they start queueing up and wait for their turn.<br/>
Once its their turn, they move from the waiting to the working area, and are assigned to a stylist.<br/>
The stylist is one of the salon employees. Every stylist has a list of services he can do. <br/>
Every service has an estimated time of completion, a cost and a list of tools and consumables needed by the stylist for completing the service.<br/>
<br/>
So, once a customer is assigned to a stylist, he asks for the list of services he wants to have.<br/>
The stylist begins the job and adds those services to the customer, so once he finishes he can quickly checkout and pay.<br/>
<br/>
**Portal and Private Salon Routing rule**<br/>
It is a portal. So, every salon manager who wants to have access to it, has to create an account and provide a unique salon name.<br/>
He ll then be able to access to his own salon space by adding his salon name at the end of the url.<br/>
<br/>
For ex.: stylemanager.com: is the portal url<br/>
stylemanager.com/moustacheSalon: is the private space for the Moustache Salon <br/>
<br/>
**Technologies**<br/>
C#; SqlServer and/or AzureTableStorage; MVC; ASP NET Core<br/>
Freedom to use any JS framework to the need. <br/>
