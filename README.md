# StyleManager
Build a customizable Web portal for managing beauty salons


**Welcome**
This is a greenfield project, so everybody is welcome to join and contribute.

*Every idea starts from observation*

**Customer Flow**
Beauty salons, stylists, hairdressers and barbers do have customers. Once they enter the salon, they start queueing up and wait for their turn.
Once its their turn, they move from the waiting to the working area, and are assigned to a stylist.
The stylist is one of the salon employees. Every stylist has a list of services he can do. 
Every service has an estimated time of completion, a cost and a list of tools and consumables needed by the stylist for completing the service.

So, once a customer is assigned to a stylist, he asks for the list of services he wants to have.
The stylist begins the job and adds those services to the customer, so once he finishes he can quickly checkout and pay.

**Portal and Private Salon Routing rule**
It is a portal. So, every salon manager who wants to have access to it, has to create an account and provide a unique salon name.
He ll then be able to access to his own salon space by adding his salon name at the end of the url.

For ex.: www.stylemanager.com: is the portal url
stylemanager.com/moustacheSalon: is the private space for the Moustache Salon 

**Technologies**
